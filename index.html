          <h2>Hi!</h2>
          <p class="intro">I am an enthusiastic and driven Software Engineering graduate with an Honours degree from The Open University. 
             I am currently looking to transition into a Graduate or Junior Software Engineering role. I have a passion for Software Development and Web Design.</p>

            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Coding in Java was my first attempt at a Software Development project. 
               Java was the teaching language of choice at The Open University, and hence I chose it for the language I would use for my Honours project. 
               I must add that this was before I had been introduced to the importance of TDD, so please don't judge me too harshly. Link below:</p>

            <h3>Android Studio</h3>
            <p>My Honours project goal was to get to the point of a minimum viable product in the form of a working prototype. 
             This took the form of a mobile interactive wearable device, which consisted of an Android application running on a Nexus 5 phone held in place on the 
             wrist by an arm band designed for joggers. The App was developed using Android Studio.</p>

            <p>I Completed a course on Udemy - 'The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp', and in doing so produced a personal website hosted on github.
              This course is designed to help become a Full-Stack Web Developer, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps.

            <p>I was lucky enough to receive some one-to-one tutoring from William Cowell, who was at the time the Head Engineer for Muscle Food. 
               Now the Head Engineer at the A-Leagues in Australia. We worked on one of his personal Projects together. This was a Library for interacting with the Jaguar
            Land Rove Remote API using TypeScript. Link below: </p>

            <h3>jQuery</h3>
            <p>After graduating from University I enrolled for several other online courses to continue my learning journey. One such course was, 'The Complete jQuery Course (From
              Beginner to Advanced)'. Covering aspects such as stunning animation, fast feedback forms, handling user events, and perform Ajax calls.
